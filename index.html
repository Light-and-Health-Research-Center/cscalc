                      <b>Correlated Color Temperature (CCT, Tcp)</b> is a specification for white light sources used to describe the dominant color tone along the dimension from warm (yellows and reds) to cool (blue). Lamps with a CCT rating below 3200 K are usually considered warm sources, whereas those with a CCT above 4000 K usually considered cool in appearance. Temperatures in between are considered neutral in appearance. Technically, CCT extends the practice of using temperature, in kelvins (K), for specifying the spectrum of light sources other than blackbody radiators. Incandescent lamps and daylight closely approximate the spectra of black body radiators at different temperatures and can be designated by the corresponding temperature of a blackbody radiator. The spectra of fluorescent and LED sources, however, differ substantially from black body radiators yet they can have a color appearance similar to a blackbody radiator of a particular temperature as given by CCT.

A negative Duv indicates that the source is “below” the blackbody locus, having a purplish tint, whereas a positive Duv indicates that the source is “above” the blackbody locus, having a greenish tint.

Sources with CRI values less than 50 are generally regarded as rendering colors poorly, that is, colors may appear unnatural.

            <p>The human retina is not a uniform neural tissue. The highest density of cone photoreceptors in the retina is in the foveal pit, which is used for such visual tasks a reading, threading needles, and identification of distant objects. The macula is a circular region of the retina that extends radially from the fovea with a much higher density of cones than the peripheral retina which is dominated by rods. Most of the visual cortex is devoted to processing images focused in the macula. Therefore, for human conscious perception, the macula is particularly important.</p>
            <p>Interlaced among the photoreceptors and the other retinal neurons in the macula is a yellow screening pigment, the macula lutea, that is believed to protect the retina from damage by short wavelengths. The spatial extent of this circular screening pigment is approximately 6-10<sup>o</sup> with the highest pigment density in the foveal region.  Since the macular pigment preferentially filters short wavelengths and since the most effective rays entering the eye are along the optical axis, the spectral sensitivity of the central retina will be influenced by the optical density of the macular pigment.</p>
            <p>Importantly, individuals differ quite substantially in the optical density of their macular pigment. The optical density of the macular pigment for different people can range from 0.3 to 0.7; the original model by Rea et al. (2005) assumes a single optical density of 0.5 for all individuals. A new feature of the CS calculator enables users to change macular pigment density for 0.3 to 0.7 in steps of 0.05 to determine how individuals might differ in their effective CS for a given spectral power distribution. </p>
